<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

</p>
<p>
Create a Resource Group called "Active-Directory-Lab".
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://imgur.com/jamyOKY.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
As your resource group is being deployed, create the virutal network we will be using for the virtual machines to connect to. Make sure to add the resource group to this Virtual Network.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Create a virtual machine called "DC-1", make sure to use a size of at least 2 vcpus and 8 GiB memory, MAKE SURE to use the "Image" Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition - x64 Gen2, because this will be our "Domain Controller".
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
MAKE SURE you have the VM on the resource group we created, same with the Virtual Network, we will do the same for "client-1"s VM.
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://imgur.com/MzicBV5.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Create a VM called "client-1", we will be using the "image" Windows 10 Pro for client 1, Adding it to the "Active-Directory-Lab" Resource Group, as well as the "Active-Directory-VNet" Virtual Network we created.
</p>
<br />

<p>

<img src="https://imgur.com/v9XJNC1.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
After VM is created, Set Client-1's DNS settings to DC-1's Private IP Address, First we have to make sure the PRivate IP address of DC-1 wont change by setting the IP address from "Dynamic" to "Static". by clicking on DC-1's VM -> Network settings (left side) -> Click on the "Network Interface/IP Configuration" and set the IP configuration from Dynamic to Static, Press save.
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://imgur.com/B2VDboJ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

</p>
<p>
Now that we set DC-1's Private IP address to static, we will copy the IP Address of DC-1 and go to client-1's->Network Settings->Click on "Network Interface/IP Configuration"-> On the left side youll see "DNS Servers" setting->Click Custom and Paste DC-1s Private IP Address from before. Click Save and you will see that Client-1 Inherited DC-1's Private IP address. Restart Client-1 for the effects to take place.
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://imgur.com/UNyoaLg.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
We will now copy the Public IP address for client-1 and paste it into RDP so we can confirm the changes through the command line by running "ping (DC-1's Private IP Address)", After confirming all packets got sent through, Run ipconfig /all and you can see at the bottom next to "DNS servers" the Private IP address of DC-1.
